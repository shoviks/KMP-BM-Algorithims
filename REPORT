The Boyer-Moore algorithm tends to falter when working with small alphabets like DNA.  
This is because the skip distance tends to stop growing with the pattern length due to
frequent substring reoccurrences.  Boyer-Moore algorithm works better when the pattern 
and the text resemble "natural text" (such as English).  Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm
search for occurrences of a word withing a main text string by employing the observation
that when a mismatch occurs, the word itself contains sufficient information to determine
where the next match could begin, therefore bypassing re-examination of previously matched
characters.  This means Knuth-Morris_Pratt algorithm is better for small sets such as DNA.
So in conclusion, Boyer-Moore algorithm works more efficiently on long patterns and Knuth-Morris-Pratt
algorithm works more efficiently on short patterns.
